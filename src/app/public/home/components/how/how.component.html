          <p text-center>The solition is simple supply and demand. If there were a higher sulpply of social events,
              then
              the cost, complexity, and exclusivity will reduce.</p>

            <p text-center>
              We believe we can achieve this by offering to pay people to host social event, making the
              process
              rewarding for both event holders and goers.
